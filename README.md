# The FORK :

## This fork is an attempt to make OAT code working on a Sanguinololu 1.3 (atmel1284p) + NEMA 17 + A4988 steppers

Sanguinololu desc : https://reprap.org/wiki/Sanguinololu

Sanguinololu features :
* Chip : atmel1284p
* 4x NEMA 17
* 4x A4988
* 2x temp inputs
* 2x heater or cooler outputs

Uploading firmware on sanguinololu :
- IDE : Visual Studio Code + PlatformIO plugin
- Interface : Using an Arduino UNO with "Arduino as ISP" code uploaded (I was unable to upload firmware using usb)
- Wiring :
  Arduino UNO : see "Arduino as ISP" Code for pin usage
  Sanguinololu : SPI pins (remove display before wiring !)
